## Open/closed issues over time

Scripts to find the number of open/closed issues over time in the
Astropy repository:

    python get_stats.py
    python plot_stats_bokeh.py

`get_stats.py` generates `closed.txt` and `created.txt`, which are then used
by `plot_stats_bokeh.py` to generate `plot_stats_bokeh.html`, which is
interactive. The Bokeh version does not yet fully implement the static plots
generated by `plot_stats.py`, which outputs `issue_closed_stats.png`,
`issue_open_stats.png`, and `issue_stats.png`.

## Issue lifetime histograms

Scripts to create issue lifetime histograms:

    python stats_to_table.py
    python lifetime_histogram.py
